# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This project is a simple Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a user can play against an AI. The user enters a number between 1 and 9 to place their mark (X) on the board, and the AI responds with its move (O).

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. The game will display a 3x3 grid with numbered positions (1-9).
3. The user enters a number corresponding to where they want to place their mark (X).
4. The AI will automatically make its move (O).
5. The game continues until either the user or AI wins, or the game ends in a tie.
